Next to the token-based font-sizes and text colors from the [token-based](/token-based) utilities, there are a few other typography utility classes present in _Feo_.

## Text alignment

These classes set the `text-align` on the element, based on the value in the name.

- `.text-right`
- `.text-center`
- `.text-left`
- `.text-start`
- `.text-end`
- `.text-justify`

## Text decoration

- `.bold`: sets the font-weight to 600.
- `.regular`: sets the font-weight to 400.
- `.italic`: makes the text italic.
- `.no-decoration`: removes any decoration in the `text-decoration` property.

## Line height

- `.lh-0`: sets the line height to 1.75.
- `.lh-00`: sets the line height to 1.3.
- `.lh-000`: sets the line height to 1.
