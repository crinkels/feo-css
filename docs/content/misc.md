## click-area

The `.click-area` class makes a parent completely clickable based on the presence of a single, direct `<a>` child.

## visually-hidden

The `.visually-hidden` class allows you to hide an element for the users eye, but still be readable for screen readers.

## Transition

Classes that enable you to set CSS transitions on all transitional attributes of an element, as shown below.

```css
.transition-100/200/300/400/500 {
	transition: all 100ms/200ms/300ms/400ms/500ms ease;
}
```

## Aspect ratio

- `.ratio-vid`: sets the aspect ratio to 9/16.
- `.ratio-auto`: sets the aspect ratio to `auto`.
- `.ratio-square`: sets the aspect ratio to 1/1.

## `nth-child`

Feo CSS enables you to use the `--nth-child` custom property to determine the `nth-of-type` value. This is a numeric value going between 1 to 10, and can be used for various things. You will thank me later when you need it.
