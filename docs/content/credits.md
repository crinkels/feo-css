_Bace_ would not exist without the awesome work of people I admire. Many are already mentioned throughout the documentation, but here is a list of resources and credits for people that do not get this enough.

- [CUBE CSS](https://cube.fyi/) from [Andy Bell](https://twitter.com/piccalilli_) for being the main driver of the methodology of _Bace_.
- [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev/) from [Andy Bell](https://twitter.com/piccalilli_) and [Heydon Pickering](https://twitter.com/heydonworks) for inspiration of many of the layout classes.
- [Andy Bell](https://twitter.com/piccalilli_) (yes, again), for his modern and minimal [CSS reset](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-modern-css-reset/), which is used as a base in _Bace_.
- [Type Scale](https://type-scale.com/) for inspiration around font-sizes, spacing and breakpoints (and tooling to calculate).
- [Stephanie Eckles](https://moderncss.dev/generating-font-size-css-rules-and-creating-a-fluid-type-scale/) for inspiration around fluid typography.
