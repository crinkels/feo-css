title: Holy grail

The holy grail of all (old-school) websites and applications: a sticky header and footer, sidebars on the side and a body that fills all the available space, as displayed below.

Key elements of this implementation:

- The header, footer and sidebar are discarded when not used as child elements in this layout class.
- The body is scrollable. The header, footers and sidebar will remain.

The `.grail` classes requires a specific implementation to work. The header, footer and body require specific HTML tags for the class to work. However, the sidebars can use any HTML tag (`<div>`, `<aside>`, etc.).

```html
<div class="grail">
	<header>Header</header>
	<div class="any class here">sidebar</div>
	<main>Scrollable content</main>
	<div class="any class here">sidebar</div>
	<footer>Footer</footer>
</div>
```
