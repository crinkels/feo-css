Feo.css offers classes for standardized layout patterns that you see on almost every website or application.

<details open>
  <summary>Class utilities</summary>
  <p><a href="/utilities">Utility classes</a> are classes that do one thing, and one thing well. 
    Class utilities are classes that that allow you to control one aspect from a different CSS class, like a layout class. Class utilities have a post-fix of <code>--*</code> to make them easily spottable. Most of the class utilities are based on <a href="/tokens">the design tokens</a>.</p>
    <p>
      All class utilities alter internal custom properties labeled <code>--layout-*</code>. These custom properties are <i>shared</i> between the layout classes.
